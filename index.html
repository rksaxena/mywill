                <h2>What is a Will? </h2>
                <p> A Will or testament is a legal document by which you can decide the future of your all properties, investments, arms and ammunitions, gold, cash, locker etc. (PIAGCL) when you are no more in the world. The registration of the Will is not compulsory. You can always change your Will at your will and for any number of times. It has a very significant role in India for disposal of your properties as well as for making it easier for your successor to inherit your property without much legal hassles. </p>
